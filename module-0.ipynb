    "### Using the pre-built virtual machine (_prefered_)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the prefered method, but installing VirtualBox requires administrative priveleges on your system. If you cannot install VirtualBox, see if your system administrator can assist. If that fails, see the _Using Anaconda_ section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Download and install VirtualBox\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visit the [VirtualBox downloads page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and get the latest VirtualBox platform package and Extension Pack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install the VirtualBox platform package:\n",
    " \n",
    "    - Linux: Get the `.deb` or `.rpm` file appropriate to your OS and install via your package manager (apt, yum, etc.).\n",
    " \n",
    "    - OS X: Get the `.dmg` image, double click, and follow the prompts.\n",
    " \n",
    "    - Windows: Get the `.exe` installer, double click, and follow the prompts.\n",
    " \n",
    "    -  See the [installation documentation](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) if you have problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install the Extension Pack.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Launch VirtualBox, then click _File_ (Linux, Windows) or _VirtualBox_ (OS X), then _Preferences_ > _Extensions_. Click the _Adds new package_ button on the right, then navigate to and select the Extensions Pack file you downloaded earlier. Answer all questions in the affirmative to install the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Get the virtual machine\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enter the following URL in your browser to download the virtual machine archive:\n",
    "\n",
    " `ftp://ftp.nsidc.org/pub/requests/pmadden/sea-2016-tutorial.zip`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract the archive, open the extracted folder, and double-click `sea-tutorial-2016.vbox` to launch VirtualBox.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inside VirtualBox, double-click the _sea-2016-tutorial_ machine to run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Connect to Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you see the virtual machine's `jupyter login:` prompt, navigate to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Log in with username `jupyter` and password `jupyter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click to open the _sea-2016-tutorial_ link and you should see a list of the `module-*.ipynb` notebook files for the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Download and install Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Download](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) the Anaconda (Python 3.5 version) package appropriate to your system and follow the [installation instructions](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). **Unless you know what you're doing, allow Anaconda to install in its prefered location, and to modify your path.**\n",
    "- If you installed Anaconda in a terminal window (Linux, OS X), close that window now, as the changes to your path will only be active in the _next_ window you open.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Install additional packages\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a **new** terminal window:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -y netCDF4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Download the tutorial files\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visit the [GitHub page](https://github.com/p-madden/sea-2016-tutorial) for this tutorial, and either `git clone` the repo or download and expand the ZIP file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Connect to Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "- In your terminal window (Linux, OS X) or command prompt (Windows), `cd` into the directory containing the tutorial files and run `jupyter notebook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your browser should open to Jupyter, and you should see a list of the `.ipynb` notebooks for the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "_ **Note:** We will have removable media with the software-intstaller and tutorial files available at the tutorial for those who have problems installing the software ahead of time, but **please** try to prepare your software in advance!_"
